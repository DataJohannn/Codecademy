SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM countries
WHERE continent LIKE 'Africa';

-- 4. What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?

SELECT continent,
 SUM(population),
 year
FROM countries c
LEFT JOIN population_years p
  ON p.country_id = c.id
WHERE continent LIKE 'oceania'
  AND year = 2005;

-- 5. What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?

SELECT continent,
 AVG(population),
 year
FROM countries c
LEFT JOIN population_years p
  ON p.country_id = c.id
WHERE continent LIKE 'south america'
  AND year = 2003;

-- 6. What country had the smallest population in 2007?

SELECT name,
 MIN(population),
 year
FROM countries c
LEFT JOIN population_years p
  ON p.country_id = c.id
WHERE year = 2007;

-- 7. What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?

SELECT name,
  AVG(population)
FROM countries c
LEFT JOIN population_years p
  ON p.country_id = c.id
WHERE name LIKE 'Poland';

LEFT JOIN population_years p
  ON p.country_id = c.id
WHERE year = 2010
GROUP BY continent;
